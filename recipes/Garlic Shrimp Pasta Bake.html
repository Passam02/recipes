    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
            Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until <br>
            tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. <br>
            Drain and set aside until needed.
        </li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoonbutter <br>
            and oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. <br>
            Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. <br>
            Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and dill; cook until <br>
            shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is <br>
            opaque, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to <br>
            a plate, leaving any cooking juices in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over <br>
            medium heat. Whisk in flour until fully combined and <br>
            starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk <br> 
            in chicken broth until combined, then repeat with milk. <br> 
            Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; bring <br> 
            to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and Romano; stir until cheeses <br> 
            begin to melt and sauce is creamy. Add 1 tablespoon <br> 
            mozzarella cheese, then mix in 1/2 of the cooked pasta. <br> 
            Add more pasta if there is enough sauce to coat it. <br> 
            Stir in shrimp, then top with remaining mozzarella, <br> 
            Parmesan, and parsley.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top and <br> 
            bubbling around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
