    <p>
        First published in 1959 in River Road Recipes, the Junior <br> 
        League of Baton Rouge's community cookbook, spinach <br> 
        Madeline remains a favorite side dish in Southern <br> 
        Louisiana. Thick and creamy with a hint of jalapeno heat, <br> 
        it's most at home on holidays next to turkey, cornbread <br> 
        dressing, and green bean casserole. It's easy to make and <br> 
        easy to multiply for big gatherings. This may be served <br> 
        immediately or put into a casserole and topped with <br> 
        buttered bread crumbs. The flavor is improved if the latter <br> 
        is done and kept in the refrigerator overnight. This may <br> 
        also be frozen.

        <li>6 ounces processed cheese spread with jalapeno (such as Velveeta(R)), diced</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place frozen spinach and water in a saucepan over high heat; <br> 
            bring to a full boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook <br> 
            for 8 minutes. Separate with a fork and cook for 2 more <br> 
            minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add flour, stirring <br> 
            until blended and smooth, but not brown, 1 to 2 minutes. <br> 
            Add onion and cook until soft but not brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Slowly add evaporated milk and the reserved cooking liquid, <br> 
            stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring constantly, <br> 
            until smooth and thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Add processed cheese <br> 
            spread, celery salt, garlic salt, pepper, cayenne, and salt; cook <br> 
            and stir until melted, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cooked spinach.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Stir in cooked spinach and serve immediately.
        </li>
