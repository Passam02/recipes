    <h1>Dauphinoise Potatoes</h1>
    <img width="500" src="../images/dauphinoise-potatoes.webp" alt="Dauphinoise Potatoes"><br>
    <p>These Dauphinoise potatoes are luscious and creamy. The potatoes <br> 
        will be perfectly seasoned after absorbing all the flavor in the sauce, <br> 
        and come out super tender.

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and sliced 1/8-inch thick with peel</li>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic; <br> 
            cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in flour; cook, <br> 
            stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Whisk in heavy cream, milk, and salt <br> 
            until smooth. Add sliced potatoes and bring to a simmer; cook, gently <br> 
            stirring occasionally, until potatoes begin to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. <br> 
            Remove from heat; stir in thyme and pepper.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle 1/2 cup <br> 
            cheese evenly over potatoes. Top with remaining potatoes and spoon <br> 
            remaining liquid left in the pot over the potatoes. Top with remaining <br> 
            1/2 cup cheese.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened, top is browned in spots, <br> 
            and potatoes are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before <br> 
            serving; garnish with additional thyme.
        </li>
    </ol>
